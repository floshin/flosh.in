# On Philosophy

Philosophy means "loving wisdom". 
Loving discernment. 


Philosophy is 
* a persons or a groups view on (the relation of) things (as it translates to life)
* the process of developing such a view and in relation to other views (of life)
* the relation of this view to practice (integrity of acts and thoughts (in life))
* the practice itself of acting in accordance with the view (lifestyle)






The question, whether or not something is a philosophy or not, does not arise. Everyone has a philosophy, a view and attitude towards the relation of things. The only question is how reflective it is, how profound its reflections are, 


Self-Knowledge (*atmajJAna)* vs. Science (*vijJAna*).


What was philosophy ("the love for wisdom")?
Ancient philosophers have seen philosophy as a practice leading to wisdom. In modern terms, you may say, that original philosophy is more about lifestyle than science. The philosopher loves wisdom and strives for wisdom by means of reflection. 

Practising philosophy means to put all experience into question to not be a slave to the conditioning underlying and shaping our experience. Philosophy is a practice of in-depth reflection to free our minds. 

Philosophy deconstructs the patterns, thereby cleaning the mental mirror to enable clear reflection of truth (satya) or void (sunyata) respectively.

This purified, unconditional reflection is described as wisdom.

Reflection is done by thoughts expressed in ideas, expressed in words.
Reasoning... words, thoughts -> requires logic. what is logic ->

In the indian system of logic, there are four possibilities of any proposition:

*X* (affirmation)

X}![\neg X](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/da203aa7c9d097e5bf16f6f9cc482b3347ebe28e) (negation)

{\displaystyle \neg (X\lor \neg X)}![{\displaystyle \neg (X\lor \neg X)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fba0a8757459a6665632529a65f1412d3f91a1b3) (neither)

Philosophy, as every other human aspiration, is in service of life. Life is neither about reason nor logic nor any kind of "ism". Life is about acting, loving and perceiving. Abstract concepts do not matter. It matters what I do, what I think and what I feel. 
Philosophy is supposed to make our thinking, loving and perceiving wiser, that said: Make them cleaner, make them less conditioned, make them unconditional, free.


All "philosophical" doctrines are based on one of the following two sets of premises:
1. There is an absolute truth, there is a self and the self can know the truth.
2. There is no absolute truth, there is no self and nothing can be known.

The third attitude, which goes beyond these two is the sceptical and practical one:
* We don't know about truth, we don't know about the self, but we can experiment.

1. monism, atman, gnostic
2. nihilism, anatta, agnostic


1 is idealistic.
2 is nihilistic.
3 is nihilistic in assumptions, idealistic in axioms. 








These two positions are the two sides of a coin.


As such it is the historical source and the condition of any science.

By reflecting upon the conditions of our experience, by putting everything into question that we do in life, philosophy is supposed to be life-changing. If it doesn't change your life for the better, it is no philosophy. 


What we are used to call *philosophy*, is called *darshana* in India. *Darshana* can be translated to *Perspective* or *Concept* (from Sanskrit *drish*, to see, to experience). It can be described as a way to conceive life, a way of perceiving life, a way of experiencing life. There is no experience outside of life. And no one is philosophising other than the living. Thus, if philosophy is any kind of science, then it is the science of life, not in a biological sense, but in the sense of experience. 



Since both the word *darshana* as well as the philosophies originally described by it are older than whatever was invented under the term "philosophy" later, we will describe philosophies accordingly, as concepts or perspectives.

Concepts of? Perspectives of? Of life.
Every concept requires a conceiver.
Every perspective requires a perceiver.
It is life that is conceived, perceived, felt, in short: experienced.



What we know as perspectivism as developed by Nietzsche are just old buddhist ideas. 

> Nietzsche’s work relentlessly undermines the elevation of ‘literal’ over ‘metaphorical’ truth. He argues that we cannot privilege literal or ‘pure’ truth over metaphor because truth is itself a metaphor that has been invented to lend authority to particular forms of thought and styles of living.

On Karuṇā or why buddhist/vedantic ethics is amoral and practical.

In the Buddhist perspective life is characterized by three important traits: conditionality (cause and effect), impermanence, and insubstantiality.





It is widely assumed that philosophy was invented in ancient Greece, which is false. Just because philosophy as a term is of greek origin doesn't make philosophising greek, when it was done by others and before. They just used different names. 

Legend says 'philosophy' as a term was coined by Pythagoras. The oldest ancient historic sources report that Pythagoras visited Egypt and learned from egyptian priests; others claimed he was in Persia where he learned from the zoroastrian Magi, that he was in India where he learned from the Yogis or that he learned from Druids. We do not know any of that, but what we know is that his culture and thinking was heavily influenced by all those eastern streams of thought. 

We also know that the idea philosophy would be of greek origin would have been very foreign to the greeks. They called thinkers of other cultures philosophers and they knew pretty well that wisdom was to be found there. By describing them as the teachers of Pythagoras they tell us more about their own thinking and how their culture valued those eastern ideas than about Pythagoras himself. 


On philosophy in all the different cultures.

They should focus on verbs more than on nomen.
