# Fasabé

Fasabé stands **for acrobatic skill and balletic ease**. This project is a place for my ideas on acrobatics and to show the beauty of hand to hand. Notes evolve around... #acro #h2h #mxp #freerange #freestyle #elegance #lifestyle

**Now:** I am currently under the remote tutelage of Galina Sinyavskaya and Olya Yatsenko
[@sinyinversion_yoga](https://www.instagram.com/sinyinversion_yoga/) while teaching girls Hand to Hand.


## Teachers

Before I got into contact with Olya Alexandrovna and Galina Nikolaevna and after my former partner retired (during the pandemic in 2020) I was coached by [Lewie West](https://lewiewest.com) on and off from 2021 to 2022. He originally inspired me to learn acrobatics as an adult in about 2009 with his [floor acro videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93uZhnwGZAA). Simultaneously I am constantly guided by Dr. [Joshua Naterman](https://labcoatfitness.com/) in all things injury prevention, (p)rehabilitation and hybrid strength training. He is supporting me since 2018 and helped me to recover from various little injuries.
