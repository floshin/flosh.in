    <h2>International<br>
         Dictionary of Acrobatics</h2>

    <p>
      Flosha: The idea to create a dictionary of acrobatic terms came to me after I recognised how many different terms are used by different acrobatic schools even inside the same country. There is no common language to describe skills. Thus, this 'International Dictionary of Acrobatics', which is open source and work in progress, tries to
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>collect the most common names for acrobatic skills or other acro related terms used in different languages (mainly english, russian, german and hebraic)</li> 
      <li>describe the said skills/terms in a short and easy-to-grasp manner and ideally to add descriptive pictures, animations (gifs) or video references to visualise the terms and</li>
      <li>serve as a basis for discussion on acrobatic terminology in order to find a common language of reasonable terms to use</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>A</h3>
    <ul class="dictionary">
      <li><strong>Acrobatics</strong> short <em>acro</em>, from greek XY, 'walking on tip toes', ...</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dislocate</strong> Short <em>Disloc</em>, a mount to two arm H2H and the reverse of the Inlocate (Podsetchka), where the shoulders of the top move over extension into the overhead position, whereas in the Inlocate they move over flexion into the overhead position; to achieve this without actual dislocation of the shoulder joint, the shoulders have to rotate, which requires a reversed position of the wrists (underhand grip of the base) which are then turned 180째 alongside the hands and shoulders of the top during the mount, which may require a wider positioning of the arms during the shoulder rotation depending on the tops shoulder mobility; the initiating motion is almost identical to the Diamidov, where there is only one hand in reversed grip.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1-9</h3>
    <ul class="dictionary">
      <li><strong>1/4</strong> 90째 rotation: Going from vertical to horizontal or horizontal to vertical in saltos, rolls etc.</li>
      <li><strong>2/4</strong> 180째 rotation: Going from vertical to vertical or horizontal to horizontal (standing to handstand, handstand to standing, lying supine to lying prone or vice versa)</li>
      <li><strong>3/4</strong> 270째 rotation: Like going from standing over supine to overhead to prone as one example</li>
      <li><strong>4/4</strong> 360* rotation: Fully rotated saltos, rolls etc. from standing to standing or handstand to handstand etc.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>V</h3>
