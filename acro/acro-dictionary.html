    <h2>International<br>
         Dictionary of Acrobatics</h2>

    <p>
      Flosha: The idea to create a dictionary of acrobatic terms came to me, after I recognised how many different terms are used by different acrobatic schools even inside the same country. There is no common language to describe skills. Thus, this 'International Dictionary of Acrobatics', which is open source and work in progress, tries to
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>collect the most common names for acrobatic skills or other acro related terms used in different languages (mainly english, russian, german and hebraic)</li> 
      <li>describe the said skills/terms in a short and easy-to-grasp manner and ideally to add descriptive pictures, animations (gifs) or video references to visualise the terms and</li>
      <li>serve as a basis for discussion on acrobatic terminology in order to find a common language of reasonable terms to use</li>
    </ol>
